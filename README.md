# ðŸ“š Crimson - Typed WebSocket Framework for Ktor

## Overview

**Crimson** is a lightweight, type-safe WebSocket communication framework for [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).  
It provides a production-ready foundation for both **server** and **client** WebSocket communication by enhancing session management, reconnection control, and seamless typed data exchange.

âœ… Type-safe send/receive  
âœ… Session management and timeout handling  
âœ… Automatic reconnection  
âœ… Built on top of Ktor WebSocket APIs  
âœ… Coroutine-friendly and highly extensible

---

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `crimson-server` | Manage WebSocket sessions with connection limits, session timeouts, and safe broadcasting on Ktor servers. |
| `crimson-client` | Build type-safe WebSocket clients on Ktor clients. |

---

## Features

### Crimson Server
- Typed WebSocket session management
- Maximum connection limit enforcement
- Session lifetime timeout with watchdog monitoring
- Safe broadcasting to connected clients
- Coroutine-based non-blocking design

### Crimson Client
- Type-safe WebSocket communication
- Auto-reconnection support with customizable retry policies
- Heartbeat (ping-pong) monitoring and disconnection detection
- Coroutine-based incoming message streaming
- JSON serialization/deserialization based on Kotlinx Serialization

## Installation

**TBD â€” Will be available soon.**  
(We are preparing distribution settings. Stay tuned!)

---

## Basic Usage

### Server Side (Ktor)

```kotlin
install(Crimson) {
    crimsonConfig("chat") {
        // Optional: Configure server behaviors (handler, incoming serializer, outgoing serializer, etc.)
    }
}

routing {
    crimson<ChatMessage, ChatResponse>(
        path = "/chat",
        config = "chat"
    ) { sessionRegistry ->
        incomingMessageFlow.collect { message ->
            // Handle incoming chat message
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Client Side (Ktor)

```kotlin
val crimsonClient = CrimsonClient<ChatMessage, ChatResponse>{
    crimsonHandler = object: CrimsonHandler<ChatMessage, ChatResponse> {
        override suspend fun onConnect(crimson: CrimsonClientCore<ChatMessage, ChatResponse>, flow: SharedFlow<ChatResponse>) {
        }

        override suspend fun onError(e: Throwable) {
            println(e)
        }

        override suspend fun onClosed(code: Int, reason: String) {
            println("$code $reason")
        }
    }

    webSocketEndpointProvider = object: WebSocketEndpointProvider {
        override suspend fun build(): ConnectionInfo {
            return ConnectionInfo("ws://127.0.0.1:54321")
        }
    }

    retryPolicy = RetryPolicy.SimpleDelay(30.seconds)
    incomingSerializer = ChatResponse.serializer()
    outgoingSerializer = ChatMessage.serializer()
}

launch {
    crimsonClient.execute(CrimsonCommand.Connect)
}

launch {
    crimsonClient.incomingMessage.collect { incoming -> println(incoming) }
}

crimson.send(ChatMessage(message = "Hello!"))
```

## Why Crimson?

While Ktor provides basic WebSocket support, it focuses only on low-level I/O.  
**Crimson** bridges the gap by providing:

- Strong typing for safer communication
- Built-in session lifecycle management
- Automated connection health monitoring
- Reconnection strategy management (client-side)
- Production-grade robustness and scalability
